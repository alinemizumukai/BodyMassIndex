# Body Mass Index Calculator
Project developed for the Mobile Applications Development Course offered by ARINTER | CPS using Android Studio to develop Android apps with Kotlin.

*Task Requirements:*

Create an app to calculate the BMI (Body Mass Index) of a person.

Your app should have two EditText widgets, one for the user’s height (in meters) and the other for the user’s weight (or more scientifically accurate, mass, in kilograms). 
Put also on your interface a Button and a TextView.

When the user touches de button:
* Check to see if there are values on both EditTexts. If any of them are empty, tell the user to type the required values using a Toast.
* If the user supplied the values, calculate his BMI using this formula:

* Show the result value for the user’s BMI, and the BMI category, on the TextView.
